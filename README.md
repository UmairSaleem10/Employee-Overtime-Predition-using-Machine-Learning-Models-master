A manufacturing unit is consistently facing project over-time to finish. This is usually a sign for poor project planning or resource allocation. Now the company has decided smartly allocate the resource based on ML models. One indicator they have about project going out-of-budget is number of employees working overtime. If a good predictive model can help them predict which employees are expected to do overtime, then they can balance the resource allocation accordingly.

Salary prediction is crucial for organizations to ensure fair compensation and budgetary planning. Implementing a machine learning model to predict employee salaries can provide valuable insights for efficient financial management. By analyzing various factors influencing salary, such as job level, years of experience, and education, the company can make informed decisions about compensation packages and optimize budget allocation.
